## Summary
Medium Severity Finding: FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol::claimERC20Prize.

## Vulnerability Detail
When claiming an ERC20 prize via the claimERC20Prize function, the totalERC20Claimed mapping updates as expected.
The issue is that the following _token.transfer is not checked, meaning the totalERC20Claimed is updated regardless
of whether the transaction was successful.
This subsequently updates the state value totalERC20Claimed incorrectly.

There is a check to ensure that value > 0, but if the value is 0 we still continue to emit a ClaimERC20 event.

## Impact
The vulnerabilities could impact the protocol by making leaderboards redundant and spammed by malicious users.
There would also be an overhead of useless ClaimERC20 logs, that show ClaimERC20 events with a value of x ETH,
when x ETH was not sent.
Logs with 0 ETH would also be present if the remainder of _amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] = 0.

In it's current state, debugging the Event logs would present major problems, as the 'valuable' logs will be muddied
with non-valid logs. Spamming the ClaimERC20 event could also cause gas related issues and a DOS.

Incorrect updates of the state value totalERC20Claimed will continuously push the stated totalERC20Claimed value
further from the 'true' value, and will require a newly deployed contract or contract upgrade to be set correctly
if the recommended change is not made.

## Code Snippet
A simple check of the returned value from _token.transfer(_to, value) will overcome this issue.

function claimERC20Prize(...) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        ...

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            
            // @audit -- What if the intended transfer fails? We have changed the totalERC20Claimed
            // but the transfer has failed.
            
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }

        // @audit -- If we have failed we still emit the ClaimERC20 event.
        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
    
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Simple changes to ensure a 0 value will not emit a invalid ClaimERC20 event, the mapping totalERC20Claimed is not
incorrectly updated after a transaction fails, and a clearer code structure.

function claimERC20Prize(...) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        ...

        if (value <= 0) revert InvalidETHValue(value);
        
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
        bool success = _token.transfer(_to, value);
        if (!success) revert FailedToSendETH(value);
        
        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
